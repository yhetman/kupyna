### Implementation of Kupyna hash function.

The Kupyna hash function was approved as the new Ukrainian standard **DSTU 7564:2014** in 2015. Main requirements for it were both high security level and good performance of software implementation on general-purpose 64-bit CPUs. The new hash function uses Davies-Meyer compression function based on Even-Mansour cipher construction. Kupyna is built on the transformations of the Kalyna block cipher (**Ukrainian standard DSTU 7624:2014**).
